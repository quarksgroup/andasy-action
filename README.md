2. Copy the generated token value.

### Set Up Repository Secrets

Add the copied token value to your GitHub repository secrets:

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
2. Go to `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions`.
3. Click `New repository secret`.
4. Add a new secret with the name `ANDASY_ACCESS_TOKEN` and paste the token as it's value or (`Secret *` field).
